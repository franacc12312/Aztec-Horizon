# Contributing to Aztec Horizon

Thank you for your interest. We welcome ideas, code, research, and design.

## Ways to contribute
- Open an **Idea Proposal** issue to pitch a project or feature.
- Join **Discussions** for brainstorming, Q&A, and progress updates.
- Improve docs, examples, or tests.

## Workflow
1. Open or pick an issue. Align scope, success criteria, milestones, and labels.
2. Create a branch and reference the issue in commits.
3. Submit a PR using our template. Include a short demo, screenshots, or a CLI transcript when possible.
4. At least one maintainer reviews, CI must pass.
5. We squash merge, unless there is a strong reason to keep commits.

## Code style and practices
- Keep things simple, readable, documented.
- Prefer small, well scoped PRs, tests and examples out of the box.
- Document assumptions and security considerations.

## Labels
We use labels like `area:app`, `area:tooling`, `status:help wanted`, `good first issue`, `bounty`, `grant`, `noir`, `docs`.

## Project board
We maintain a public board for roadmap and status. Columns, backlog, in progress, review, done.
