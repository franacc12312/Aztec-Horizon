# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability
Please report security issues privately. Use GitHub Security Advisories or email the security contacts in `GOVERNANCE.md`. We will acknowledge receipt within 72 hours, provide a timeline for a fix, and credit reporters if desired.

## Scope
Repositories under the Aztec Horizon umbrella. If your report concerns Aztec core components outside this org, we will route it to the right team.

## Disclosure
We practice responsible disclosure. Do not open public issues for security problems before coordination.
