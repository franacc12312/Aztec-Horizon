# Aztec Horizon

**Aztec Horizon** is an internal, community facing exploration program, focused on shipping bold, open source experiments on Aztec. Our goal is simple, show that the new world of privacy native applications is already under construction, invite builders to co create it with us.

## What this is

- A branded umbrella for early stage projects, reference implementations, and design probes.
- A place to turn PRDs into working code, fast.
- A clear path for contributors, designers, developers, researchers, to propose ideas and earn grants or bounties.

## Why now

Aztec is early, yet not empty. We have momentum, we have talented builders, and we want to balance that signal with an open invitation to explore. Horizon projects will showcase what only Aztec can enable, private UX, selective disclosure, novel coordination patterns.

## How to participate

- **Propose an idea**, open an issue using **Idea Proposal** template.
- **Apply for a grant or bounty**, use the **Grant or Bounty** template, check `/grants`.
- **Pick up a task**, search issues by labels like `good first issue`, `bounty`, `tooling`, `noir`.
- **Join discussions**, use GitHub Discussions for ideas, Q&A, and show and tell.

## PRDs

We maintain product requirement documents under `/prds`. If you already have a PRD, add it following the template in `/prds/templates/PRD_TEMPLATE.md`, then open a PR.
