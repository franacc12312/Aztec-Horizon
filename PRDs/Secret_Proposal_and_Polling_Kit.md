# Secret Proposal and Polling Kit

## 1) Vision and value proposition

**What it is**: a confidential deliberation toolkit for DAOs on Aztec, run anonymous sentiment polls, draft proposals in a private workspace, reveal only aggregates or finalized text, protect contributors and strategy.

**What it solves**

- Encourages honest feedback without social pressure.
- Prevents early leak of sensitive initiatives or partnerships.
- Bridges informal discovery to formal private voting cleanly.

**Expected customer outcome**

- Better proposals, clearer signals, fewer leaks, faster consensus.

## 2) Target users and needs

**Primary personas**

1. **Core Contributors** want space to draft and test ideas safely.
2. **Token Holders** want to signal preferences without being targeted.
3. **Governance Facilitators** want structured intake and clean handoff to voting.
4. **Legal or Risk** wants scoped access for sensitive topics.

**Jobs to be done**

- As a contributor, I want to float a proposal privately and gather feedback.
- As a holder, I want to answer polls anonymously and see trusted aggregates.
- As a facilitator, I want to promote a draft to a vote with minimal friction.

## 3) Core use cases

1. **Anonymous sentiment polls**, quick pulse checks on roadmap or spending.
2. **Secret draft room**, proposal text and attachments visible only to a committee.
3. **Partner or M and A incubation**, share redacted outlines privately before public reveal.
4. **Post mortems**, candid feedback with private attributions.
