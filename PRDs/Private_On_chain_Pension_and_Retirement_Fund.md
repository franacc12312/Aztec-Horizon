## 1) Vision and value proposition

**What it is**: a privacy native retirement plan on Aztec where employees and contributors make recurring deposits, employers match, balances grow in approved strategies, and all sensitive data stays private by default. Auditors and regulators can receive selective proofs on demand, no full ledger exposure.

**What it solves**

- Protects personal savings, salaries, employer policies, and allocations from public chain analytics.
- Reduces operational risk and data leakage in payroll linked contributions and vesting.
- Delivers verifiable compliance and solvency without sharing unnecessary PII or position level detail.

**Expected customer outcome**

- Run a compliant, portable retirement plan with cryptographic receipts, private balances, predictable operations, and clear selective disclosures when required.

## 2) Target users and needs

**Primary personas**

1. **Employer HR and Payroll Manager** wants to onboard employees, configure matching rules, execute contributions, and see status, without leaking salaries or identities.
2. **Treasury or Plan Sponsor** wants funding predictability, policy controls, and aggregated reporting, with private underlying positions.
3. **Employee or Contributor** wants easy enrollment, private balance view, risk choice, benefit statements, and portability between employers.
4. **Fund Manager or Strategy Provider** wants to accept plan inflows and publish performance proofs without revealing full books.
5. **Compliance Officer and External Auditor** wants scoped evidence for contributions, vesting, and solvency, with approvals and audit trail.

**Jobs to be done**

- As HR, I want to run recurring contributions and employer match with private receipts and automatic retries.
- As a sponsor, I want to prove the plan meets funding and policy constraints without exposing individual balances.
- As an employee, I want to see my private balance and vesting, change risk bands, and transfer my plan when I change jobs.
- As compliance, I want to answer audits with minimal, time bound disclosures that show rules were enforced.
